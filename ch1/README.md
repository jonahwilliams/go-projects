The only program of any complexity here is server2, which generates Lissajous figures in a browser.  Additionally, it has been programmed to take four query parameters.
"cycles", which configures the number of cycles (default 5), and the colors "red", "green", and "blue" (default 0) which control 
the color of the figures generated.  Any invalid params cause the server to fallback on the default values.
